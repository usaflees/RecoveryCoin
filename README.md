The Recovery Coin, is a cryptocurrency, an altcoin that is based on the PeerCoin.  Our Vision is to one day be able to get people the help they need, when they need it the most and make the the life changing choice to make a change in their lives.  Too many times, my self included, have been denied because of full facilities and many more problems.  Things need to change, and we are here to do our part.
