# RecoveryCoin
The Recovery Coin, is a cryptocurrency, an altcoin that is based on the PeerCoin.  Our Vision is to one day be able to get people the help they need, when they need it the most and make the the life changing choice to make a change in their lives.  Too many times, my self included, have been denied because of full facilities and many more problems.  Things need to change, and we are here to do our part.

The Recovery Coin Team

If you would like to contribute, we are a very small team with limited experience to go around.  All help is very much appreciated!  Please contact us at stevenmlees@me.com

We have also Purchased our new Domain! I was able to scrape together the neccesary funds, praise the lord.

As always, to help out with our project, we are looking for anyone, bloggers to get the word out, etc. if you have done anything related to creating a coin and the wallet that will hold the coins, please contact us.
